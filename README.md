# Household Authority Inequality

## Problem Background
In 2022, Indonesia is in the 85th position out of 149 countries in the global gender gap rankings. Although the rank is relatively low, the data shows that 1 out of 4 people in Indonesia are still experiencing gender inequality. For example, in employment, the female tends to work in informal jobs, receiving low and unstable income, contradicting men. Also, a man is still considered superior in the household to the woman. This gap between women and men must be immediately balanced.

According to a 2019 MSNBC survey, 62.5% of married couples said that the authority in the household was divided equally. While the other 37.5% said one person has more control in the household (tends to be the husband). One factor that makes this extraordinary is Indonesian women's belief that men are superior.

## Purpose

## Conclusion
Based on data, wives' participation in household decisions in Indonesia is relatively high. The cause of this inequality can be influenced by several factors such as belief, applicable laws, education, and other aspects. These inequalities result in unequal opportunities for men and women. With the belief that the wife can be superior to her husband, accompanied by improvements in several aspects, the wife is expected to have more significant opportunities in the future.
