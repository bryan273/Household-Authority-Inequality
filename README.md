# Household Authority Inequality

## Problem Background
In 2022, Indonesia is in the 85th position out of 149 countries in the global gender gap rankings. Although the rank is relatively low, the data shows that 1 out of 4 people in Indonesia are still experiencing gender inequality. For example, in employment, the female tends to work in informal jobs, receiving low and unstable income, contradicting men. Also, a man is still considered superior in the household to the woman. This gap between women and men must be immediately balanced.

According to a 2019 MSNBC survey, 62.5% of married couples said that the authority in the household was divided equally. While the other 37.5% said one person has more authority in the household (tends to be the husband). One of the factors that makes this extraordinary is the belief of Indonesian women that men are superior
